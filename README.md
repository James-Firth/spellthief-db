# spellthief-db
SpellThief DB is a project with the goal of providing developers with all the D&amp;D spells in easy-to-use formats.


## Features

Planned features and known issues can be found in the [Github Issues](https://github.com/James-Firth/spellthief-db/issues).

Some spells may not be available via the OGL and many DMs like to create their own. Thus I would also like to make it easy to add spells to SpellThiefDB.

Tested in Chrome by pasting the following code into the console on this page:
